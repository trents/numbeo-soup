# numbeo-soup
This script uses the Python BeautifulSoup library to extract specific city data from Numbeo.

To run, download numbeo.py and city-list.txt to the same directory and run with
python numbeo.py

It will create an output file called output.txt, a comma-delimited file in the format:
CityName,Cappuccino

By default the script extracts the price of a regular cappuccino from each city
